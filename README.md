# CrownSteal
by Moxvallix

The idea for this pack was proposed by **Invictus Gaming**.

## About
CrownSteal is a small Datapack that adds a game of *royal* tag to your Minecraft world.

One player is the King, and is granted an all powerful crown. The King is mighty, but not invincible!
Behead the King, and the crown is yours!

## Setup
To begin the game, run: 
```
/trigger crownsteal.start
```
This will pick a player on the server randomly to be the King.

If you wish for a particular player to be King, run: 
```
/trigger crownsteal.stop
/team join crownsteal.king <player>
```

To stop the game, run:
```
/trigger crownsteal.stop
```
